# ToyLang
Toylang is a toy in the literal sense as a tiny implementation of a language and a fun side-project. Toy stands for: Tim's Outstanding Y..Y...YnnhgLanguage.

## Design

Toy borrows a few ideas from newer trendy languages such as swift and rust; namely the inclusion
of optionals and mut keywords. It also tries to retain familiarity for programmers familiar with common language concepts. That is, it should be readable and easy to pick up (like a toy).
It is strongly typed, (data cannot be cast to other types easily) and it is also statically typed (type checks are done
before run-time).
