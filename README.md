# ToyLang
Toy is fun project that was started in order to get me create a programming language on my own. I chose the name TOY
because it is literally a programmer 'toy' as a tiny implementation of a language and a fun side-project, and because
due to the brevity of the name I could easily make it into an acronym.
Toy stands for: Tim's Outstanding Y..Y...YnnhgLanguage.

## Design
At the time of writing, Toy borrows a few ideas from newer trendy languages such as swift and rust; namely the inclusion
of optionals and mut keywords. The goal of this language however is not to incorporate as many newer concepts and ideas
as possible. It needs to also retain familiarity for programmers familiar common language concepts. That is, it should
be readable and easy to pick up (like a toy). Due to this, there is some light influence from older conventional
languages like Java and C.
It is strongly typed, (data cannot be cast to other types easily) and it is also statically typed (type checks are done
before run-time).
