Toy is fun side-project that was designed to let me create my first language by myself. Toy stands for; Tim's
outstanding y... Language.

It is strongly typed, (data cannot be cast to other types easily) and it is also statically typed (type checks are done
before run-time).

It is fairly simple and I hope to construct a way to make types soon.
