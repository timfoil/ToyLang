## How to view parse trees generated by your grammar (.g4 files)
 Either use intellij plugin for ez-mode or do the following if you want to do it manually

grun <path-to-class-files> <grammar-rule> -gui <path-to-toy-file>


grun net.travitz.lang.toy.ToyLang module -gui ..\..\..\ToyTestCode\OneFunction.toy

(ran in 'ToyLang/build/classes/java/main' directory)

## How to generate parsers/lexers manually with antlr

 antlr4 is a bat file in the scripts/folder but I also have it in my PATH
 run this in the grammar directory for a quick way to generate the current grammar

antlr4 ToyLang.g4 -o ..\output\ -visitor -package net.travitz.lang.toy
